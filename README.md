# Microscopy-Image-Compilation
A quick script to generate a compilation of images (in this case, for testing CLEM protocols and observing fluorescence at different steps along the protocol)

This script will create compilations of the CLEM microscope images. A separate
pdf file will be generated for each of the treatment conditions. The image
inputs are direct RGB .tif exports from Volocity and assumes that the green
channel image will have the filename "T00001C02Z001.tif" and the red channel
image will have the filename "T00001C01Z001.tif".
